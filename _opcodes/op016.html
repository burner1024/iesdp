Applies the Haste effect, in the style specified by the 'Type' value.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<br/>0   Normal Haste - double the movement rate and grants an additional Attack Per Round (APR), rounded down (capped at 6)
<br/>1   Improved Haste - double the movement rate and doubles APR (capped at 10)
<br/>2   Weak Haste – Speed haste without attack bonuses, round APR up (capped at 5)
<br/><br/>All of them set STATE_HASTED. Improved/Weak function by setting an additional STAT value, which modifies the behavior of STATE_HASTED:
<ul>
	<li>STAT 155 – IMPROVEDHASTE.</li>
	<li>STAT 185 – ANIMATION_ONLY_HASTE.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The normal and improved haste types grant a -2 initiative (weapon speed) bonus. All types:<br/>
- grant portrait icons<br/>
- increase the creature's animation speed and the animation speed of Opcode 140 effects<br/>
- halve the creature's round timer used by attacks, modal abilities and "Auto-Pause: End of Round"<br/>
- increase frequency of application of <a href="#op25">poison</a>, <a href="#op78">disease</a>,
 <a href="#op98">regeneration</a>, <a href="#op232">Cast on Condition</a> and <a href="#op272">Use EFF File (at Frequency)</a>, but not below 1s
</p>

{% capture note %}
This effect will cancel out the <a href="#op40">slow opcode</a>.

{% capture note %}
BG1 only supports haste type 0.<br/><br/>
This opcode will set the STATE_HASTED flag and nothing else when applied with timing mode 1,
 and cannot be removed within the game by any means, only suppressed by <a href="#op40">Slow</a>.
This only works when applying normal/improved haste (there's no difference, since the STAT for
 improved haste doesn't get set this way), weak haste does not do anything with timing mode 1.
